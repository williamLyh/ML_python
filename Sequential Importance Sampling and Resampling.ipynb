    "\n",
    "Our target is to find $\\mu$, where $\\mu = E[f(x)] = \\int_D f(x)p(x) dx$. Simple Monte Carlo method suggests:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mu \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N f(x^i)  \\qquad x^i \\sim p(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "However, simple Monte Carlo method may fail when f(x) are nearly zero outside region A and $P(x\\in A)$ is small. Intuitively we would like to have more samples from the important region A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we use Importance Sampling:\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mu & = \\int_D f(x) \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}q(x) \\quad dx = E_q\\Big[f(X)\\frac{p(X)}{q(X)} \\Big] \\\\\n",
    "& \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N f(X_i)\\frac{p(X_i)}{q(X_i)} \\quad X_i \\sim q\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Assume we can compute f(x), to use the above equation, we have to be able to compute $p(x)/q(x)$. Details about the estimate variance and how to choose $q(x)$ were discussed in details in the reference book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## self-normalized importance sampling\n",
    "Sometimes we can only have unnormalized p(x) and q(x), therefore we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat\\mu_q = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N f(X_i)w(X_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^N w(X_i)} \\quad X_i \\sim q\n",

    "### A short example of Importance Sampling:\n",
    "Say we want have a chopped cosine function:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p(x) = \\frac{1}{Z}\\cos x \\quad x\\in[0,1]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "Now we would like to know the average of this distribution $E[x]=\\int_0^1 xp(x)$. It's hard to sample from $p(x)$, so we sample from $q(x)=Uni(1) \\quad x\\in[0,1]$. Therefore, the self-normalized importance sampling give:\n",
